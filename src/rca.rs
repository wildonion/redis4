        race conditions means that two threads want to mutate the data

        wait there is a threads that is trying to mutate this type and 
        will update you once the lock gets freed and in order to avoid blockcing 
        issues in the current thread we have to lock inside a separate thread 
        and mutate the type in there like tokio::spawn() then send it through 
        the jobq channel to the other threads for reading and future mutations
